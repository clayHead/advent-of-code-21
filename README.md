# advent-of-code-21
Code for the Advent of Code 2021

Hopefully this Submarine doesn't sink!

Goals for the project:
1. Tackle each day's problem to the best of my ability
2. Make code that is extensisible and reuseable
3. Make code that properly handles errors with inputs
4. Future-proof my code!
	
	Bonus Goal: Dont import any python libraries!
  
This is my first year doing advent of code, so I am focused on excercising my best-practice programing skills,
rather than learning anything new or fancy. Maybe next year!
